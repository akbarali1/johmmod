This package started on the basis of [league/plates v.3.3.0](https://github.com/thephpleague/plates/releases/tag/3.3.0).
The development of the original package went in a direction that was not suitable for our projects where Plates was used, so it was decided to develop our own separate library.  

The purpose of the development was to **simplify the source code as much as possible**, get rid of the unnecessary and **add the missing functionality**.
